          NOW IN POLICE CUSTODY
        </h5>
        <div className="text-justify body">
          <p>
            We are Lawyers/Human Right Activists from the above named address.
            We humbly wish to apply for the bail of {title}.
            {`${firstName} ${lastName}`} who shall be referred herein under and
            for the purpose of this application as OUR CLIENT. We have been
            brief by Our Client who has been suspected and arrested for an
            alleged offence of {offence}.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having now been briefed on what led to the arrest of Our Client, at
            this stage, the question is not whether the suspect committed the
            above offence or not? But the question is whether the suspect who
            was arrested and detained since the {arrested_on}, by men of the
            Nigeria police force till date without any formal charge preferred
            against him should be allowed to remain indefinitely in police
            custody without being admitted to bail? This indeed is the pedestal
            upon which this application is anchored.
          </p>
          <p>
            We humbly wish to draw the mind of the police to the following
            issues which may undermine Our Client’s Fundamental Right as
            provided in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
            1999 (as amended). The issues contain therein are provided inter
            alia:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              That the detention of a suspect for more than 24hrs on an
              allegation of an offence without trial is a fragrant violation of
              the Suspect’s Constitutional Rights. See Section 35(4) and (5) of
              the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as
              amended.
            </li>
            <li>
              That I know as a fact that from the {arrested_on}, when That I
              know as a fact that from the {arrested_on}, when the suspect was
              arrested till date, the Nigeria Police Force should have concluded
              investigation, if any fact exist of any crime at all.
            </li>
            <li>
              That where investigation is not being able to be concluded within
              24hours, the suspect should be released on bail or be charged to
              court within the constitutional period.
            </li>
            <li>
              In considering this application, we urge the Nigerian Police, with
              respect, to look at both the provisions of the constitution of the
              federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as amended, and as provided to
              arrive at just decision.
            </li>
            <li>
              case of Chinemelu V.C.O.P (1995)4NWLR,(pt390)367, where the court
              held on page 483 paragraphs E to F, thus: “Where the police or the
              executive arbitrarily detain a citizen in circumstances outside
              the purview of section 243 of CPL, or any other written law, then
              that is derogatory to the due process of law and antithetical to
              democracy.”
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Base on the foregoing, it will be in the interest of justice to
            release the suspect on bail where investigation is not being
            concluded within the constitutional stipulated period. If
            investigation has been concluded and no facts exist of any crime,
            the suspect should also be release on bail or be charged to court
            where such facts exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-bold">TAKE FURTHER NOTICE</span> that should
            your institution fails to comply with the Constitutional provisions
            stipulated above, the fundamental Rights of Our Client will be
            violated in which case we will not hesitate to file a fundamental
            Right Application.
