        WRITTEN ADDRESS IN SUPPORT OF THE INSTANT APPLICATION
      </h6>
      <div>
        <h6>A.      BACKGROUND FACT</h6>
        <p>
          The Applicant, who is a Nigerian, is an adult of full age. On the 31st
          day of July, 2017, the Applicant was arrested at Oyigbo, Port
          Harcourt, in Rivers State, by men of the Nigerian police force. The
          Applicant was detained and tortured by the Nigerian Police Force from
          the 31st day of July, 2017, till the 23rd day of August, 2017, when he
          was charged to Chief Magistrate Court Port Harcourt, on the charges
          provided on the charge sheet exhibited herein. The Honourable Court
          presided over by his worshipSir, S. D Andrew Jaja, Esq., upon seeing
          the charge sheet No: PMC/1736C/2017 declined jurisdiction and ordered
          that the Applicant be remanded in prison custody and the case file
          sent to the Director Public Prosecution, Rivers State for advice/or to
          prefer a formal charge/or information against the Applicant in the
          appropriate court for trial. Since the 23rd day of August, 2017, till
          now, when his worship made the above orders, only part of it had been
          compiled with, that is, the order relating to the detention of the
          Applicant at the prison custody and that of remitting the case file to
          the Respondent, while the order preferring a formed charge against the
          Applicant has been disobeyed by Respondent, hence this application to
          enforce the Applicants’ fundamental Rights as enshrine in our
          constitution and the African charter on human and peoples right
          (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, 2014, pending the filling of
          appropriate information and trial of the Applicant has supported the
          Application with his name and description, the reliefs that he is
          seeking from the Court , and grounds  upon which the reliefs are
          sought and an affidavit of 22 paragraphs deposed to by the Mother of
          the Applicant. We are respectfully relying on all the paragraphs of
          the supporting affidavit and the only exhibit thereof.
        </p>
        <h6>B.     ISSUE FOR DETERMINATION</h6>
        <p>
          Whether the Applicant should remain indefinitely in detention without
          being admitted to bail pending the filling of appropriate information
          against him before a court of competent jurisdiction?
        </p>
        <h6>C.     ARGUMENT  </h6>
        <p>
          The only issue formulated for determination in this application is,
          whether the Applicant should remain indefinitely in detention without
          being admitted to bail pending the filling of the appropriate
          information against him before a court of competent jurisdiction? My
          Lord, at this stage, the question is not whether the Applicant
          committed the above offence contained in the charge No: PMC/1736C/2017
          or not? But the question before my Lord for determination is whether
          the Applicant who was arrested and detained since the 31st day of
          July, 2017, by men of the Nigeria police force and later taken to
          Chief Magistrate court on the 23rd day of August, 2017, and finally
          remanded in prison custody till date without any formal information
          preferred against him should be allowed to remain indefinitely without
          being admitted to bail? This indeed is the pedestal upon which this
          application is anchored. In considering this application, this court
          is urged, with respect to look at both the provisions of statute, the
          constitution of the federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as amended, and
          case laws that had in the past dealt with similar situations to arrive
          at just decision.
        </p>
        <h6>LET US BEGIN WITH OUR CONSTITUTION</h6>
        <p>
          The plenitude of the judicial powers of court under our 1999
          constitution, as amended more especially section 6 (6) (a) (b), 35 (1)
          (4) and 36 (5) including the provision of section 32 (1) and (2) of
          the administration of Criminal justice Law of Rivers State, No. 7 Law
          of Rivers State of Nigeria, 2015, and Articles 6,9 and 12 of the
          African charter on Human and People Right (Ratification and
          Enforcement) Act 2004, provides the necessary checks and balances for
          undue or imagined excesses of the executive arm of the Government, so
          that where the circumstances warrant, such as the instant case, when
          the Applicant  has been detained since the 31st day of July, 2017, and
          on the 23rd day of August, 2017, when the court made a valid and
          subsisting order that the prosecution should prefer a formal charge/or
          information against the Applicant in the appropriate court of law, any
          citizen who is arbitrarily incarcerated (like the Applicant) will by
          the force of law regain his liberty. We refer you to the case of
          Chinemelu V.C.O.P (1995)4NWLR,(pt390)367, where the court held on page
          483 paragraphs E to F, thus: “Where the police or the executive
          arbitrarily detain a citizen in circumstances outside the purview of
          section 243 of CPL, or any other written law, then that is derogatory
          to the due process of law and antithetical to democracy. That will
          signal on head-on-romance with anarchy and a police state”
        </p>
        <p>
          By virtue of Section 36 (5) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal
          Republic of Nigeria, as amended, “Every person who is charged with a
          criminal offence shall be presumed to be innocent until he is proven
          guilty”. This position is irrespective of the nature or gravity of the
          offence charged. The court of Appeal, per MUNTAKA-COOMASSIE, J.C.A
          (Delivering the leading judgment) gave credence to the constitutional
          provision cited above in BOLAKALE V. STATE (2006) INWLR (pt 269) page
          507, particularly at page 519 paragraphs G this:
        </p>
        <p>
          “The constitutional position is clear, whether the offence is of a
          serious nature or not, the accused is still presumed innocent. Ours is
          not inquisitorial but accusatorialsystem”.
        </p>
        <p>
          My Lord, we humbly submit with respect, that this humble application
          should not be refused the Applicant by this court simply  looking at
          the alleged offenses on the face of the charge sheet filed in the
          magistrate court, a court without jurisdiction, more so, which amount
          to a holding charge, hence, such refusal by this Honourable Court when
          the prosecution has failed to do the proper thing, will definitely
          serves as a punishment or to make the Applicant suffer indignity which
          this court as a court of justice is not to encourage. As rightly
          observed by the Lord Russel of Kilowen in R V. Rose (1895-9) ALL ER
          350; “It cannot be too strongly impressed on the magistracy of the
          country that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment but that the
          requirements as to bail are merely to secure the attendance of the
          prisoner at trial”.
        </p>
        <p>
          This pronouncement by Lord Russel, is a classical statement of the
          law, this position of law may have well prompted NGUTA, J.C.A. in the
          case of IKHAZUAGBE V. THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE (2005) ALL FWLR (pt
          266) 1323, 1340 paragraghs A-B to held thus: “In our criminal law and
          procedure, the accused is presumed innocent until the contrary is
          proven irrespective of the nature or gravity of the offence with which
          he is charged… Denial of bail cannot be used to punish him for the
          crime with which he is charged and for which he is yet to be tried”.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the provisions of our constitution, and relevant statutes, it is
          clear that our laws are against unnecessary detention of citizens
          without trial, which is the case of the Applicant in this application.
        </p>
        <h6>WE CAN NOW LOOK AT CASE LAW FOR OUR GUIDE.</h6>
        <p>
          We are minded to start here with taking critical look at the factors
          to be considered by the court when considering an application for
          bail. In the case of James Donbaba V. The state (2001)14 NWLR (Pt 687)
          396, GALADIMA, S.C.A, (as he then was) stated the conditions on page
          407 paragraghs G to H thus:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Whether the proper investigation of the offence would be prejudiced
            if the accused person is granted bail and there is a serious risk of
            the accused person’s escape from Justice by jumping bail.
          </li>
          <li>
            The nature of the offence or charge which the accused person is
            facing before the court and the risk of his interference in the
            prosecution of the case; and
          </li>
          <li>The strength of the violence against the accused person”.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It is to be noted that all the above factors may not be relevant on
          all applications for bail pending trial and the factors above are not
          exhaustive. It may be well that any one or more of the above factors
          will be relevant in any given situation, see the case of Anajemba V.
          the Federal Government of Nigeria (2004) 13 NWLR (Pt 890) 267, 283,
          Paragragh H.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the instant case no information has been preferred against the
          Applicant and no proof of evidence to determine the nature of the
          offence and/or the strength of the evidence against the Applicant. The
          Applicant has in support of this application filed an affidavit of 22
          paragraphswherein he has clearly stated thus:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li> that no information has been preferred against him.</li>
          <li>that no valid evidence against him.</li>
          <li>
            that if admitted to bail, the investigation of this case will not be
            prejudiced.
          </li>
          <li>that he will not interfere with police investigation, if any.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Considering the weighty deposition in the affidavit evidence before
          this court in this case, it is clear that the Applicant has shown
          strong reasons why this application should not be refused by the
          court.
        </p>
        <h6>
          Let us now look at cases were no formal information were preferred
          against accused person, yet they were detained and the attitude of
          court towards same.
        </h6>
        <p>
          We will begin with the case of Nwinyima V. Cop (2005) II NWLR (Pt.
          936) 255. In this case, the Applicant was arrested on the 17th
          December, 1999 for an allege offence of armed robbery involving a
          motorcycle, (like that of the accused person case in the instant
          application) He was taken before the chief magistrate court, Onitsha
          on the 25th January 2000. The chief magistrate,   remanded the accused
          person in custody and ordered the police to accelerate the
          investigation of the matter for the advice of the Director of public
          prosecution. After waiting for information to be taken out against the
          accused person without any positive result, the accused person filed
          an application for bail which was refused by the lower court.
        </p>
        <p>
          In condemning the act by the lower court and in admitting the
          Accused/Applicants to bail, the court of appeal, Ogebe J.C.A (as he
          then was) while delivery his leading judgment held thus in page 261
          paragraph C-D:- ‘’It showed that the Respondent simply dumped in
          prison Custody on a  so-called allegation of armed robbery without
          doing anything for several years to file information and proof of
          evidence in respect of the alleged offence. This is totally unjust and
          is an unwanted invasion of the Applicant’s right to personal Liberty.
          No reasonable court of law can ignore such a breach…’’
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, the Applicant was admitted to bail. Secondly, in ANAEKEWE
          V.C.O.P (1996) 3 NWLR (Pt 436) 320, the Appellant and nine others were
          charged for conspiracy and murder before the chief magistrate court,
          Onitsha on the 2nd December 1994. The learned chief magistrate ordered
          that the accused persons be remanded in prison custody. An Application
          for bail was filed. The earned trial judge refused the application
          mainly on ground that the offence allegedly committed is murder. Tobi
          J.C.A (as he then was) while delivering the leading judgment in page
          332, paragraph H made the following illuminating pronouncement:
          “learned counsel for the respondent, in his brief referred to the
          charge preferred against the appellant in the magistrate court. Can he
          really do that in law? How can he refer to a charge before a court
          without jurisdiction in a court with jurisdiction,  but is ask to take
          a bail Applicant without a formal charge by way of information? The
          so-called charge (No MO/844C/194 before the Chief Magistrate Onitsha)
          is moribund and the law treats it so’’
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, the court admitted the Appellant to bail, furthermore, in
          Enmer V. COP (1993) 6 NWLR (pt. 299) 333, 341, onu J.S.C. (as he then
          was) when faced with similar situation said:
        </p>
        <p className="font-italic">
          “In the case of Dogo V. COP (1980) INLR 14 at Page 17, it was
          emphasized that it is the duty of the court to consider whether to
          grant bail once an accused has pleaded not guilty  to a charge. Such a
          situation clearly arises where no information or charge is laid before
          the trial court. No so in the case in hand where no information or
          charge is laid by the prosecution. Hence, in the absence of fact which
          the prosecution was duly bound to supply justifying the Appellant’s
          detention in police cell, the trial Judge was bound to let Appellant
          go from the police cell”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Court also admitted the Appellant to bail. The same situation
          arises in the instant case and my Lord is urged with respect to follow
          the wise reasoning of the court above and admits the Applicant to
          bail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, in the case of Shagari V.C.O.P (2007) 5 WWLR (Pt. 1027) 275,
          the court of Appeal, Jos Division following the well-established
          reasoning stated above relating to instances where no information has
          been filed against a detained citizen admonished the prosecution on
          page 283, summarized at ratio thus: “The state should always endeavor
          with minimum of delay, to file charge and proof of evidence especially
          to allegation of commission of capital offence or any other serious
          crime. It is through such proof of evidence that a court before which
          an application for bail in such offence(s) is filed, will be
          influenced or persuaded in granting or refusing bail since it is only
          by examination or consideration of the proof of evidence that a court
          will ascertain whether there is prima facie evidence to warrant the
          continued detention of an accused person”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanusi J.C.A concluded on page 296 paragragh F thus:- “In a situation
          where there is no formal charge and proof of evidence the court will
          obviously be influenced to grant bail on such offence (s) as the
          absence of such proof of evidence could qualify as special
          circumstance to warrant the grant of bail”
        </p>
        <p>
          My Lord, it is further submitted that, in the event of the prosecution
          coming up to oppose this application, it will certainly not be enough
          to make bare assertions that the Accused/Applicant should not be
          granted bail on the ground that the Accused/Applicant would abscond or
          interfere with or obstruct the course of justice if released on bail,
          the prosecution must state clearly the antecedents of the Applicant
          not coming up to face trial or his where about being difficult to
          trace in the past or how he would interfere with or obstruct the
          course of justice. See the case of Chedi V.A.G Federation (2006)13NWLR
          (pt 997) 308,328. In view of the conclusion reached by the superior
          courts of Nigeria, we respectfully urge my Lord to follow the wise
          reasoning and admit the Applicant to bail pending when the respondent
          will prefer a charge or information against him in an appropriate
          court of law.
        </p>
        <h6>D.     CONCLUSION</h6>
        <p>
          We submit, with respect that the facts as shown in the supporting
          affidavit to this application and the grounds in support, constitute
          yet another special and exceptional circumstances that would warrant
          this Honourable Court to admit the Applicant to bail. We finally,
          Submit, that the Application has unequivocally placed before this
          court relevant material upon which the discretion of the Court may be
          exercise in his favour. Speaking on the need for a court to adopt a
          liberal approach to bail, Oguntude J.C.A (as he then was) while making
          his contribution stated in the case of Danbaba V. State (supra) on
          page 412 paragraghs B thus: “Against the background of the above
          provision of the 1999 constitution, a court              must always
          bear in mind the necessity to approach the question of bail liberally
              and generously…”. Accordingly, we submit and urge this court to
          admit the Applicant to bail on liberal terms pending when information
          will be taken out against him. May it please my Lord.
